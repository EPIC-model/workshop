# Welcome to the EPIC workshop!

This repository serves as a tutorial to show you how to prepare, run and analyse a moist bubble
simulation using the [Elliptical Parcel-In-Cell (EPIC)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpx.2023.100136)
method. During the course of this workshop, we provide you temporary access to the
Cirrus UK National Tier-2 HPC Service at EPCC (http://www.cirrus.ac.uk) funded by the University of 
Edinburgh and EPSRC (EP/P020267/1). All information how to access Cirrus is provided below.
If you would like to work on your own laptop, feel free to do so. However, we might not be able to
help you in case you face any issues regarding code compilation (not necessarily EPIC!).
